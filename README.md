# A-One Clothing Redesign (Project A) — Version 1

Static redesign for a Kingston-area business website (Phase 1: HTML/CSS/JS only).

## Tech
- HTML / CSS / Vanilla JS
- No database (per Phase 1 constraints)

## Run locally
Option 1 (recommended): VS Code Live Server
1. Install the **Live Server** extension.
2. Right-click `index.html` → **Open with Live Server**.

Option 2:
- Open `index.html` directly in your browser.

## Notes
- Email signup is a **static demo** (no backend in Phase 1).
- Replace placeholder social links with the client’s real URLs if required.
